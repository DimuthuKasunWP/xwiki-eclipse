The directory structure may appear strange but it's required by the Maven PDE plugin.
See http://mojo.codehaus.org/pde-maven-plugin/usage.html for more details.

There are 2 builds:
* The plugin build which generates an Eclipse plugin for XEclipse. It's located in plugins/org.xwiki.eclipse
* The RCP build which generates a standalone executable version of XEClipse. It's located in plugins/org.xwiki.xeclipse.rcp

To build each one just run "mvn install" in its build directory.
