The directory structure may appear strange but it's required by the Maven PDE plugin.

A new, refactored and improved version of XWiki Eclipse is now available in the repository. 
This version has a new architecture and a better integration with the Eclipse platform.

This new version is made of the following plugins and features:
 * org.xwiki.eclipse.core
 * org.xwiki.eclipse.ui
 * org.xwiki.eclipse.xmlrpc
 * org.xwiki.eclipse.feature

In order to build:

1) Checkout the trunk: "svn co http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/xwiki-extensions/xwiki-eclipse/trunk/"
2) cd to trunk/features/org.xwiki.eclipse.feature.
3) Do a "mvn -DeclipseInstall=/AbsolutePath/To/Your/Eclipse/Installation" compile.
4) You should now have a org.xwiki.eclipse.feature_1.2.0.SNAPSHOT.bin.dist.zip file in this directory.

In order to install:

1) Unzip org.xwiki.eclipse.feature_1.2.0.SNAPSHOT.bin.dist.zip into your Eclipse directory.
2) Run Eclipse.
2.1) If XWiki Eclipse doesn't show up anywhere (for example when you open the Window->Show view->Other... dialog)
     then you might need to re-run Eclipse by specifying the -clean switch on the command line.

You can start using XWiki Eclipse by creating a connection using the File->New->Other... menu command.
XWiki connections will be accessible from the Project Explorer and XWiki Navigator.

Enjoy.
